This changelog tries to summarize the most important changes to OpenThesaurus
so that you can update your OpenThesaurus installation from CVS.
Please also check include/config-template.php for new configuration
settings (not all of which I list here).

2024-02-17:

2008-11-22:
-New homepage design and other small design changes
 Affected files: several

2008-09-28:
-Thanks to Martin Srebotnjak OpenThesaurus can now create .oxt files,
 i.e. extensions that are used in the upcoming OpenOffice 3.0 to
 install different kinds of add-ons and dictionaries.
 A new option TARGET_OOO3 has been introduced in config.php.
 NOTE 1: The export script works on the output files of 
 ooo_new_export.php, so ooo_new_export.php must always be run
 before ooo_oxt_export.php!
 NOTE 2: You need to carefully configure description_template.xml
 and Dictionaries.xcu to remove the references to German ("de").
 README_OOo3_template will also need to be adapted to your needs.
 Affected files:
  For building the thesaurus file:
  www/admin/index.php
  www/admin/description_template.xml
  www/admin/README_OOo3_template
  www/admin/ooo_oxt_export.php
  www/OOo2-Thesaurus/Dictionaries.xcu
  www/OOo2-Thesaurus/META-INF/manifest.xml
  For linking the new file:
  include/download_small.php
  include/config-template.php
  www/faq.php
  messages.po/mo

2008-07-29:
-The meta information which lets people add OpenThesaurus as a search engine
 in their browser's search bar is now embedded on every page
 Affected files: include/top.php

2008-06-15:
-Linked Yahoo for external searches, removed to Google link
 that duplicated the Wikipedia/Wiktionary search
 Affected files: include/external_searches.php

2008-04-10:

-Two strings ("News" and "Archive") on the homepage had not
 been translated
 Affected files: www/index.php

2007-10-12
-Use the OpenSearch standard so that at least Firefox can
 auto-detect the OpenThesaurus search url. Simply clicking on
 the list of search engines in the upper right corner of the
 Firefox window lets you add OpenThesaurus (unless it is added
 already).
 Affected files: include/top.php, include/config-template.php,
  new file: www/opensearch.php

2007-09-27
-avoid error when converting chars outside of latin1
 Affected files: include/external_searches.php

2007-09-24
-The homepage now offers an RSS feed of the latest changes,
 thanks to Marcin Milkowski.
 The feed will be written to "www/feed.xml", so make sure PHP 
 can write to that file.
 NOTE: this only works with REALTIME_STATS_UPDATE set to 0,
 as the refresh of the feed happens when the statistics are
 updated
 *** WARNING *** about privacy change: this feed contains the 
 user names, i.e. everybody can see by whom each change was made

2007-08-21
-Registering and sending reminder emails could cause
 error messages because of the use of mysql_real_escape_string()
 in tool.php. A workaround has been added by opening a MySQL
 connection.
 Affected files: www/do_register.php, www/do_remind.php

2007-08-18
-Added new option MEMORY_DB that uses a memory
 database for similarity search and substring search,
 making those types of searches much faster. You need
 to call admin/recreate-mem-db.php regularly (e.g. via
 cronjob) to update the memory database so new words
 can be found.

2007-08-05
-Fixed links to Wikipedia that contain uppercase letters
 (Wikipedia URLs are case sensitive)
 Affected files: include/wikipedia_links.php

2007-07-22
-Added new page that lets the user browse all words 
 alphabetically.
 Affected files: www/a-z.ph (new), www/include/styles.css,
 	messages.po/mo

2007-07-16
-New option SUPERSETS_IN_OVERVIEW which decides whether
 to display the superordinate synsets in overview.php
 Affected file: www/include/styles.css,
 	include/config-template.php, include/synset.php,
 	messages.po/mo
-Superordinate words now printed with usage information
 Affected file: www/synset.php

2007-07-11
-New feature: Show links from Wikipedia. The links
 need to be extracted from an XML Wikipedia dump
 using WikipediaLinkDumper.java which produces SQL
 output. This output then needs to be imported into MySQL.
 Affected files: include/wikipedia_links.php (new),
 	www/overview.php,
 	java/de/openthesaurus/wikipedia/WikipediaLinkDumper.java (new)

2007-07-09
-Avoid displaying duplicate word forms in word_detail.php
 Affected file: include/tool.php

2007-07-07
-Improved the similarity search that is triggered if there's
 no direct match: now also searches the normalized field
 (words.lookup)
 Affected file: include/tool.php
-Improved display of words in variation.php
 Affected file: www/variation.php, include/tool.php

2007-07-05
-New option WORD_DETAIL_WITHOUT_AUTH, links and allows access
 to word_detail.php to users who are not logged in.
 Affected files: include/tool.php, include/config-template.php,
  www/word_detail.php, www/synset.php

2007-05-11
-The Wiktionary import has been improved to only import entries
 of a given language (Wiktionary for language "X" included several
 languages, not only words in language "X"!).
 The language -- actually the string that is searched for in the XML
 dump -- is set using the new option WIKTIONARY_LANG.
 Affected file: include/config-template.php, admin/import_wiktionary.php
-Fixed the similar word suggestions which sometimes could 
 offer words that had already been deleted (probably affects
 only German).
 Affected file: include/tool.php

2007-04-22
-The call to iconv() has been commented out, doesn't seem to
 be necessary anymore(?)
 Affected file: include/wiktionary.php

2007-04-22
-The substring search had some bugs that should be fixed now.
 Affected file: include/tool.php

2007-04-05
-Print word forms from (optional) word_forms table in word detail page

2007-03-05
-The links on the homepage are now in an external file.
 Affected files: www/index.php, www/links.php (new file)

2007-02-20
-The hit count in the search log got broken by the latest changes
 Affected files: www/overview.php

2007-02-17
-Improved output in case there are no matches: the first output
 isn't just "No matches" anymore but a "Did you mean..." list.
 Affected files: www/overview.php, include/levenshtein.php,
  include/synsets.php + translation files

2007-02-08
-Changed the statistics to display number of subscribed users (instead
 of total number of user actions)
 Affected files: www/stats.php

2007-01-20
-Added two new config settings: TOP_SYNSET_NAME_ADJ, TOP_SYNSET_ID_ADJ.
 If TOP_SYNSET_ID_ADJ is not -1, the page tree.php will display a tree
 of adjectives. Remember to copy the changes from config-template.php
 to config.php.
 Affected files: www/tree.php, include/config-template.php

2007-01-14
-When tree.php is called with openall=1, the tree will be completely
 expanded (there is, however, no such link that points to
 this feature yet).
 Affected files: www/tree.php

2007-01-14
-Setting a word as an antonym now gives a better error message
 (not just SQL error) if that word was antonym of another word
 already.
 Affected files: www/word_detail.php, messages.po/mo

2007-01-12
-Improved the subject and body of the suggestion mail:
 print word in subject, link word in mail body
 Affected file: www/suggest.php

2007-01-07
-The top synset for verbs cannot be assigned a superordinate 
 synset anymore.
 Affected file: www/synset.php

2007-01-04
-The myaddslashes() function has been improved to use
 mysql_real_escape_string() instead of addslahses() for
 improved security. This also means that OpenThesaurus
 is supposed to be used with MySQL.
 Affected file: include/tool.php

2006-12-31
-fixed registration: mailing list subscription mail was sent even
 without the checkbox being clicked
-improved suggestion mail (suggest.php) to show synset

2006-12-12
-date of users latest login is stored in database:
 ALTER TABLE `auth_user` ADD `last_login` DATETIME NULL ;

2006-11-19
-some fixes for regex quoting in several files

2006-10-29
-Added a form to the login page so users can suggest words without logging in.
 The suggestion is mailed to the admin (see config-template.php).

2006-10-14
-Improved user action logging in word_detail.php

2006-09-23
-Improved logging (needs database change, see thesaurus.sql)

2006-09-03
-Extended search log:
 ALTER TABLE `search_log` ADD `webservice` TINYINT NOT NULL DEFAULT '0';

2006-09-02
-new option UTF8_DATABASE in config.php

2006-08-28
-The German OpenThesaurus has been moved to a new server. PHP5 is used now,
 pages are in UTF-8 now (should only affect German-specific pages).
-Security fixes have been ported from latest phplib

2006-08-27
-tagged as version V_1_0 before server move

2006-06-18

 via webservice (XML-RPC)

2006-06-17
-changed SQL query in include/synsets.php for better performance

2006-06-15
-The tree view now shows usage information, i.e. "colloquial" etc. 
 (affected files: include/tool.php, www/tree.php)
-Each synset (synset.php) now links directly to the tree view
 if the synset has subordinate or superordinate synsets

2006-06-13
Usability: always place cursor in search field (not just on the homepage)

2006-06-11
-Duplicate matches in substring search have been fixed (tool.php)
-new option DISPLAY_LANGUAGE_LINK

2006-06-10
The export for OpenOffice.org 2.x now also lists antonyms.

2006-05-05
Imprint/contact information has been moved to its own page
(www/imprint.php)

2006-04-15
I had to rename the variable $base_url in config.php to the constant
BASE_URL because of some error messages I suddenly got on the online
server.

2006-04-15
Added a feature to use synonyms and meanings from Wiktionary. These
are imported into an extra table using admin/import_wiktionary.php and
are then displayed on overview.php.

2006-04-15
The Levenshtein algorithm is faster now, as it doesn't take into
account the first character of the user input (i.e. it assumes
the first character is correct). Use getSimilarWords(..., $fastmode=0) 
to get the old behavior.

2006-04-14
Security fix: the value used in the SQL query in getSimilarWords() was not escaped

2006-04-14
Refactorings; added colum to 'uses' table, use this command
to create it:
ALTER TABLE `uses` ADD `shortname` VARCHAR( 255 ) NOT NULL ;
New options in config-template.php:
DEFAULT_SEARCH
SPELLCHECK_EXE
SPELLCHECK_DICT_BASE

2006-04-09
Moved news on the homepage to its own file (news.php) that get included.

2006-04-07
Antonym support activated. An antonym is a pair of words (not synsets),
it can be set on each word's properties page.

2006-03-18
ATTENTION: the license of the German OpenThesaurus data has been changed,
so I had to modify register.php. After an update make sure that the text
in register.php is still valid for your project.

2006-03-17
www/OOo-Thesaurus/COPYING is now a placeholder, not a real license anymore.
You need to replace it with e.g. GPL, LGPL, ...
www/COPYING has been removed. The license relevant to the project (not the
data) is the COPYING file in the top-level directory.

2006-03-12
The meta tag that prevented robots from indexing the page has been removed 
from synset.php.

2006-02-23
The exported ZIP for OpenOffice.org >= 2.x (ooo_new_export.php) now doesn't
contain a subdirectory anymore. This makes the format compatible with the
one expected by DicOOo.

2006-02-22
Only relevant for German: added support for Swiss version (OOo 2.x only)

2006-02-19
The export for OpenOffice.org >= 2.x (ooo_new_export.php) has been modified to 
use the lookup field. This means that entries like "(sich) �bernehmen" can now
be found in OpenOffice.org when searching for "�bernehmen".

2006-02-04
A database index was missing. Creating it can speed up synset.php
for cases where many recent changes are listed:
ALTER TABLE `user_actions_log` ADD INDEX ( `synset_id` );

2006-01-21
Users can now change the subject of a synset (e.g. 'Chemistry', 'Physics', ...),
until now this was only possible for the administrator

2005-11-14
ooo_new_export.php can now optionally export subordinate concepts.
Thanks to Marcin Milkowski for the patch.

2005-06-03
The time a user's search takes is now logged.
Extend your database structure using this command:
ALTER TABLE `search_log` ADD `searchtime` FLOAT;

2005-05-22
Antonym support was still broken, some of this has been fixed but it
still has a bug.

2005-05-16, updated 2005-05-18
Added support for antonyms -- only accessible for admin
now as it needs more testing.
This requires the following change to the database:
CREATE TABLE `antonyms` (
 `id` INT NOT NULL ,
 `word_meaning_id1` INT NOT NULL ,
 `word_meaning_id2` INT NOT NULL ,
 PRIMARY KEY ( `id` ) ,
 INDEX ( `word_meaning_id1` , `word_meaning_id2` ) 
);
ALTER TABLE `antonyms` ADD UNIQUE (`word_meaning_id1`);
ALTER TABLE `antonyms` ADD UNIQUE (`word_meaning_id2`);

2005-04-17
Export for OOo2 now supports generic terms. Set some values at the top
of admin/ooo_new_export.php to configure this behaviour.

2005-04-02 (German data change, not relevant for anyone else)
Added:
	-20 largest cities in Germany, according to
	 http://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liste_der_Gro�st�dte_in_Deutschland
	-all German Bundeslaender (except Berlin, Bremen, Hamburg,
	 as these are already under "Stadt, Ort")
	-Wochentage

2005-03-03
The export for OOo 2.0 (www/admin/ooo_new_export.php) should work now.

2004-07-03
A new feature has been added to the admin page that makes sure you don't
miss any action. Just click the "Continue checking" button and you will
be shown all unchecked actions in small chunks. Use the following statements
to update your database:

CREATE TABLE `admin_checks` (
 `keyname` VARCHAR( 255 ) NOT NULL ,
 `value` VARCHAR( 255 ) 
);
INSERT INTO `admin_checks` ( `keyname` , `value` ) 
VALUES (
 'check_date', NULL 
);

2004-06-26
Added a new 'lookup' column. If an entry contains a string with
parentheses these will be removed and the result will be put in
the lookup field. This way people can find (German) "freuen"
even if the entry is "(sich) freuen". Use the following statements
to update your database:

ALTER TABLE `words` ADD `lookup` VARCHAR( 255 ) ;
ALTER TABLE `words` ADD INDEX ( `lookup` ) ;

2004-04-09
Made words.word non-binary so that MySQL SELECT statements
are case-insensitive by default now. The unique index had to
be removed for this. Execute the following SQL commands
if you update, otherwise users' searches will not be 
case-insensitive:

ALTER TABLE `words` DROP INDEX `word`;
ALTER TABLE `words` CHANGE `word` `word` VARCHAR( 255 ) NOT NULL;
ALTER TABLE `words` ADD INDEX ( `word` );

2003-05-09
Translated user-visible pages to English. German translation
available and used by default.

2003-04-18
Added a page so that synset properties can be modified. 
Currently only the admin can access it.

2003-04-17
Added 'use' information (currently for admin user only), i.e. a 
word in a given synset can be used colloqiually etc.
